Design and Documentation of a New Programming Language
Task: Design a pedagogical programming language for Turkish students of programming. These may be high school or university students that are not necessarily studying for an IT-related profession. The language should be a nice starting point (first language) for who wishes to learn programming.
•	Write a complete EBNF (or BNF) definition of the language’s syntax. 
•	Write a User’s Guide (in Turkish) that defines the syntax and the semantics of the language. (Like an e-book)
•	Please note that the task does not cover the design or implementation of any compiler or interpreter. (only the language itself is to be designed)
Deliverables: A complete User’s Guide for the language, with the BNF syntax definition attached as an appendix. (upload to Egeders System)
